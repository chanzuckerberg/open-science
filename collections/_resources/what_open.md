## Overview of open science

FIXME

- [Open Science Training Handbook](https://open-science-training-handbook.gitbook.io/book/)
- [What is Open Science? Introduction](https://www.fosteropenscience.eu/content/what-open-science-introduction) from FOSTER
- [Guide for Reproducible Research](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/reproducible-research/open.html#) from the Turing Way

## Terminology

FIXME

- **open science:** efforts to make scientific research deliverables, including data, protocols, software, and publications, accessible to anyone
- **open access**: online, freely available, peer-reviewed scientific content that is licensed for reuse
- **open source**: software for which the source code is available with a license allowing reuse, adaptation, and further distribution

Please see the [Open Science Training Handbook Glossary](https://open-science-training-handbook.gitbook.io/book/glossary)
for a more extensive,
searchable list of terms related to open science.
