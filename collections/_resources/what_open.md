## Terminology

Like other areas of science,
open science includes specific terminology and technical language that can be a bit daunting.
The following definitions differentiate terms that are used frequently on this site:

- **open science:** efforts to make scientific research deliverables, including data, protocols, software, and publications, accessible to anyone
- **open access**: online, freely available, peer-reviewed scientific content that is licensed for reuse
- **open source**: software for which the source code is available with a license allowing reuse, adaptation, and further distribution

Please see the [Open Science Training Handbook Glossary](https://open-science-training-handbook.gitbook.io/book/glossary)
for a more extensive,
searchable list of terms related to open science.
