This topic page provides context for researchers interested in applying open science practices,
but who are unsure which approaches are most appropriate.

## Open science requirements

When considering what open science practices to adopt for a specific project,
it is useful to consider the stakeholders in such decisions,
such as the funding agency sponsoring the research,
host institution at which the research is being conducted,
and/or journal in which research will be published.
Each of these entities may have expectations surrounding 
publishing protocols, availability of data,
sharing code, and accessibility of publications.
Even if these groups do not have *requirements*
for open science approaches,
they may support or provide access to resources that can make your open science endeavors easier to enact.

## Planning ahead for open science

FIXME

- data management plan
- software management plan
- discuss plans with all project collaborators
