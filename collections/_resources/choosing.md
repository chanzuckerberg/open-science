This topic page provides context for researchers interested in applying open science practices,
but who are unsure which approaches are most appropriate.
The information presented here may also be useful for developing policies
related to open science and/or open access.

## Open science policies

When considering what open science practices to adopt for a specific project,
it is useful to consider the stakeholders in such decisions,
such as the funding agency sponsoring the research,
host institution at which the research is being conducted,
and/or journal in which research will be published.
Each of these entities may have expectations surrounding 
publishing protocols, availability of data,
sharing code, and accessibility of publications.
Even if these groups do not have *requirements*
for open science approaches,
they may support or provide access to resources that can make your open science endeavors easier to enact.

> If you are part of a project receiving funding from CZI,
> please see [our CZI grantees page](/open-science/czi-grantees/)
