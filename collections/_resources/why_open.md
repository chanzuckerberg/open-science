This page collects information and articles about how open science benefits both science and individual researchers.

For more information about what research practices are involved in open science,
see the [What is open science?](/open-science/resources/what_open/) topic page.

## Benefits for science

The following articles provide more in-depth information about how science,
including both the scientific community and society at large,
benefits from open science:

- [What are the benefits of Open Science?](https://www.fosteropenscience.eu/content/what-are-benefits-open-science)
- [Why open science is critical to combatting COVID-19](https://www.oecd.org/coronavirus/policy-responses/why-open-science-is-critical-to-combatting-covid-19-cd6ab2f9/) 

## Benefits for individual researchers

[Open science challenges, benefits and tips in early career and beyond](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3000246)
provides an overview of how researchers can use open science to enhance their careers.

For more information on how researchers can maximize the credit they and their peers receive for implementing open science practices,
see the [Getting credit for open science](/open-science/resources/credit/) topic page.

## Motivating open science practices

[Motivating participation in open science by examining researcher incentives](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5662284/)
reports on interviews with researchers about open science practices,
and describes both motivations and disincentives to participate in such activities. 
The following resources provide more general information about how incentives work to motivate individuals:
