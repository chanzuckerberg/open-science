It is standard practice to include information about experimental methods 
in published manuscripts.
These descriptions, however,
are often insufficient to reproduce experimental results.
This section describes open science approaches to sharing protocols,
including both written instructions for methods
as well as physical resources (like reagents).

### Experimental protocols and methods

While there are multiple ways to share details of experimental methods,
one existing solution is [protocols.io](https://www.protocols.io/),
a platform for developing and sharing reproducible methods.
This platform is free for academic users to publish and share protocols publicly.

Protocols can be organized into groups,
such as the following:
- [Human Cell Atlas Method Development Community](https://www.protocols.io/workspaces/hca/publications)
- [Neurodegeneration Method Development Community](https://www.protocols.io/workspaces/neurodegeneration-method-development-community1/publications)

Experimental protocols shared in [protocols.io](https://www.protocols.io/)
can also include computational pipelines and analytical workflows
(but see the section on **Software and code** section 
for more information on resources for reproducibility of computational methods).
Publishing computational methods in protocols.io is extremely powerful 
when a new data generation system is being documented,
as it unites the data collection and analysis approaches.
An example of this approach is this protocol from the Human Cell Atlas Method Development Community:
[MARS-seq2.0: an experimental and analytical pipeline for indexed sorting combined with single-cell RNA sequencing](https://www.protocols.io/view/mars-seq2-0-an-experimental-and-analytical-pipelin-7hkhj4w).

### Reagents and physical resources

Examples of physical reagents and other resources that can be shared include:
- cell lines
- plasmids/vectors
- animal models
- antibodies
