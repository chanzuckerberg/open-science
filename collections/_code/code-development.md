## Getting started with coding

### Learning to code

- [Ten simple rules for biologists learning to program](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005871)
- code vs script vs software
- what needs to be shared for reproducibility
- best practices

### Version control with Git and GitHub

[GitHub Learning Lab](https://lab.github.com/) contains a large number of free tutorials
for tasks relevant to writing and sharing research code, including:

- [Introduction to GitHub](https://lab.github.com/githubtraining/introduction-to-github)
- Creating websites with [GitHub Pages](https://lab.github.com/githubtraining/github-pages)

### Contributing to a project

If you're not familiar with GitHub,
please see the [version control section](#version-control-with-git-and-github)
to get started.

### Code architecture and design

### Strategies for debugging

### Testing and continuous integration

## Writing software for others to use

### Writing reusable code

- [Research Software Engineering with Python](https://merely-useful.tech/py-rse/index.html)

### Documentation

- [Ten simple rules for documenting scientific software](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006561)

### Licensing

### Code citations

- how to ask for citations when your code is used in scholarly work
- how to get your code reviewed and published

### User interfaces
