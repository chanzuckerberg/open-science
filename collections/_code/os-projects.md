This topic page provides support to open source software engineering projects developed by teams of researchers.
The information is appropriate for projects that would like to develop better processes for operating as a team
and/or
develop inclusive communities around their projects. 

## Research software as a subset of open source software

There are many resources for topics presented on this page that speak to open source projects in general.
For example, the following resources are useful for thinking about open source development in general:

- [Producing Open Source Software](https://producingoss.com/)
- [Open Source Archetypes](https://blog.mozilla.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/MZOTS_OS_Archetypes_report_ext_scr.pdf)

However, this page is specifically focused on open source projects supporting biomedical research.
Such software is referred to as scientific or research software,
and represents the following general characteristics:

- smaller audiences (number of users) than other open source projects
- developers and users are associated with academia
- developers and contributors are often not primarily software engineers, but biologists
- funding is derived primarily from grants

While these characteristics are not absolute across scientific research software,
they do present certain challenges,
and may render more general resources for open source software inapplicable.
Such caveats are referenced when resources listed may not be specifically catered towards research software engineering.

For more information on how scientific (academic) software fits into the landscape of open source,
please see [Sectoring contributions to open source software (OSS) on GitHub](https://dspg-young-scholars-program.github.io/dspg20oss/?dspg). 
For a general overview of considerations in developing research software, 
please see [Ten Simple Rules for the Open Development of Scientific Software](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002802).

## Project management for research software

[Project management](https://www.usability.gov/what-and-why/project-management.html) in a general sense refers to planning and organizing a project.
Additionall, there are multiple [formal project management frameworks](https://asana.com/resources/project-management-methodologies),
such as Agile, Waterfall, and Scrum,
that provide structure and language around both team interactions and the software development process.

This section will focus on project management in a more general sense,
including specific approaches that support open science projects throughout their life cycles.

### Planning for sustainability

FIXME

[Resources from the Software Sustainability Institute](https://www.software.ac.uk/resources):

- [Software management plan](https://www.software.ac.uk/resources/guides/software-management-plans)
- [Software Evaluation Guide](https://www.software.ac.uk/resources/guides-everything/software-evaluation-guide)

Resources on financial models for general open source tools:

- [Monetizing Open Source: Business Models That Generate Billions](https://www.forbes.com/sites/glennsolomon/2020/09/15/monetizing-open-source-business-models-that-generate-billions/?sh=769ff83834fd)
- [4 successful open source business models to consider](https://opensource.com/article/17/12/open-source-business-models)

Revenue models:

- Private donations: GitHub sponsorship, [Experiment](https://experiment.com/), [Open Collective](https://opencollective.com/)
- Service models: offering training or consulting for a fee

Making the case for funding:
