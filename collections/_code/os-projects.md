### Planning for sustainability

[Resources from the Software Sustainability Institute](https://www.software.ac.uk/resources):

- [Software management plan](https://www.software.ac.uk/resources/guides/software-management-plans)
- [Software Evaluation Guide](https://www.software.ac.uk/resources/guides-everything/software-evaluation-guide)

Resources on financial models for general open source tools:

- [Monetizing Open Source: Business Models That Generate Billions](https://www.forbes.com/sites/glennsolomon/2020/09/15/monetizing-open-source-business-models-that-generate-billions/?sh=769ff83834fd)
- [4 successful open source business models to consider](https://opensource.com/article/17/12/open-source-business-models)

Revenue models:

- Private donations: GitHub sponsorship, [Experiment](https://experiment.com/), [Open Collective](https://opencollective.com/)
- Service models: offering training or consulting for a fee

Making the case for funding:

- see tracking metrics section

### Governance

### Code review

**Under construction**

## Community development

- [CSCCE Community Profiles](https://www.cscce.org/resources/scientific-community-profiles/)
- [Community starter kit](https://lab.github.com/githubtraining/community-starter-kit) from GitHub
- [The Labor of Maintaining and Scaling Free and Open-Source Software Projects](https://stuartgeiger.com/articles/2021-02-28-maintaining-scaling-foss-cscw2021/)

### Diverse, equitable, and inclusive communities

Everything is about DEI

- [CoC](#code-of-conduct)
- [Tracking project metrics](#tracking-project-metrics)
- [Accessibility](/open-science/code/code-development/#user-interfaces)
- [Organizations involved in DEI](/open-science/resources/organizations)

### Code of conduct

- Code of Conduct
  - expectations for behavior
  - reporting
  - process for resolving
- Code of Conduct Conversations in Open Source Software Projects on Github https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3449093
