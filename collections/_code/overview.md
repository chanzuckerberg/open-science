Developing software for research purposes encompasses a 
broad range of activities,
ranging from technical skills like version control
to project and community management.
Resources related to writing code include:

- [Code development](#code-development)
  - [Version control with Git and GitHub](#version-control-with-git-and-github)
- [Managing an open source project](#managing-an-open-source-project)
  - [Community development](#community-development)

## Code development

### Version control with Git and GitHub

[GitHub Learning Lab](https://lab.github.com/) contains a large number of free tutorials
for tasks relevant to writing and sharing research code, including:

- [Introduction to GitHub](https://lab.github.com/githubtraining/introduction-to-github)
- Creating websites with [GitHub Pages](https://lab.github.com/githubtraining/github-pages)

## Managing an open source project

### Community development
