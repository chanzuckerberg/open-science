This page describes training opportunities and resources hosted by the Open Science team
to support the Essential Open Source Software for Science (EOSS) grantee community.

We are also happy to meet with our EOSS grantees for project updates!
Please contact a team member to schedule a time.

## Pages of interest

While this site is intended to share a broad variety of information about
open science practices with biomedical researchers,
the following sections are of particular importance to our EOSS community:

- [**CZI grantees page**](/open-science/czi-grantees): general expectations and resources available to our supported projects.
- [**Collaborative research software engineering projects**](https://chanzuckerberg.github.io/open-science/code/os-projects): resources relevant to creation of open source software for science, including topics in project management and community development

## EOSS Training

When possible, publicly available materials are linked, 
and information about how to participate in non-CZI hosted sessions is included.

- **Code of Conduct:** If you are seeking general training on enforcing Codes of Conduct, we recommend [Otter Techâ€™s Code of Conduct Incident Response Workshop](https://otter.technology/code-of-conduct-training/).

- **Managing Research Software Projects:** [Greg Wilson](https://third-bit.com/) has a series of modules covering [product/project management](https://codebender.org/). He taught a four-part version of this course for CZI in spring 2022.

- **Scientific Community Engagement Fundamentals:** The [Center for Scientific Collaboration and Community Engagement (CSCCE)](https://www.cscce.org/) will host a custom cohort of [Scientific Community Engagement Fundamentals](https://www.cscce.org/trainings/cef/) for EOSS grantees in late July 2022.
