This page describes training opportunities and resources hosted by the Open Science team
to support the Essential Open Source Software for Science (EOSS) grantee community.
When possible, publicly available materials are linked, 
and information about how to participate in non-CZI hosted sessions is included.

Please also see our [CZI grantees page](/open-science/czi-grantees)
for general expectations and resources available to our supported projects.

- **Code of Conduct:** If you are seeking general training on enforcing Codes of Conduct, we recommend [Otter Techâ€™s Code of Conduct Incident Response Workshop](https://otter.technology/code-of-conduct-training/).

- **Managing Research Software Projects:** [Greg Wilson](https://third-bit.com/) has a series of modules covering [product/project management](https://codebender.org/). He taught a four-part version of this course for CZI in spring 2022.
