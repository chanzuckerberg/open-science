This page describes training opportunities and resources hosted by the Open Science team
to support the [Essential Open Source Software for Science (EOSS)](https://chanzuckerberg.com/eoss/) grantee community.

We are also happy to meet with our EOSS grantees for project updates!
Please contact a team member to schedule a time.

## Pages of interest

While this site is intended to share a broad variety of information about
open science practices with biomedical researchers,
the following sections are of particular importance to our EOSS community:

- [**CZI grantees page**](/open-science/czi-grantees): general expectations and resources available to our supported projects.
- [**CZI Open Science Community Calls**](/open-science/opensci-communitycalls): information about opportunities to connect with and learn from other grantees, though calls are open to all!
- [**Collaborative research software engineering projects**](https://chanzuckerberg.github.io/open-science/code/os-projects): resources relevant to creation of open source software for science, including topics in project management and community development

## EOSS Training

The CZI Open Science program has tested various support activities for open source grantees.
This section includes information about recommended materials and training opportunities we've tried.

- **Code of Conduct:** If you are seeking general training on enforcing Codes of Conduct, we recommend [Otter Techâ€™s Code of Conduct Incident Response Workshop](https://otter.technology/code-of-conduct-training/).

- **Managing Research Software Projects:** [Greg Wilson](https://third-bit.com/) has a series of modules covering [product/project management](https://codebender.org/). He taught a four-part version of this course for CZI in spring 2022.

- **Scientific Community Engagement Fundamentals:** The [Center for Scientific Collaboration and Community Engagement (CSCCE)](https://www.cscce.org/) hosted custom cohorts of [Scientific Community Engagement Fundamentals](https://www.cscce.org/trainings/cef/) for EOSS (and other open science) grantees in H2 2022 and H2 2023. Additional workshops in late 2022 covered additional topics in open source community management.

- **Application Design for Web and Desktop:** [Nielsen Norman Group](https://www.nngroup.com/) taught their [Application Design for Web and Desktop](https://www.nngroup.com/courses/application-ux/) class in December 2022 to support EOSS grantees interested in improving user experiences. 

## Add the EOSS badge to your profile

If your software project has been [funded by EOSS](https://chanzuckerberg.com/eoss/proposals/),
we recommend adding the EOSS badge to your project page:

[![CZI's Essential Open Source Software for Science](https://chanzuckerberg.github.io/open-science/badges/CZI-EOSS.svg)](https://czi.co/EOSS)

**Code snippet:**

`[![CZI's Essential Open Source Software for Science](https://chanzuckerberg.github.io/open-science/badges/CZI-EOSS.svg)](https://czi.co/EOSS)`

**Recommended language:**

This software project was supported in part by the [Essential Open Source Software for Science (EOSS)](https://czi.co/EOSS) program at [Chan Zuckerberg Initiative](https://chanzuckerberg.com/).
