This page discusses the process of publishing preprints,
as well as guidelines specifically related to areas of interest
for members of the biomedical research community.

## What is a preprint?

A preprint is a scientific manuscript that is published prior to peer review,
Preprints for biomedical research are most often published in 
[bioRxiv](https://www.biorxiv.org/) or
[medRxiv](https://www.medrxiv.org/).

Here are examples of preprints from a few different CZI-supported projects: 
- [Using genomic epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2 to support contact tracing and public health surveillance in rural Humboldt County, California](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.09.21.21258385v1)
- [CellTag Indexing: genetic barcode-based sample multiplexing for single-cell genomics](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/335547v2)
- [Super-resolution vibrational imaging using expansion stimulated Raman scattering microscopy](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.12.22.473713v1.full)
- [A reference induced pluripotent stem cell line for large-scale collaborative studies](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.12.15.472643v1)

After a manuscript has been through the peer review process and is published in a journal,
the preprint entry is updated to include a link to the final article.
For example, 
[this article](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/335547v2)
links to the final article by stating "Now published in *Genome Biology*,"
followed by the DOI.
