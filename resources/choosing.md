This topic page provides context for researchers interested in applying open science practices,
but who are unsure which approaches are most appropriate.
The information presented here may also be useful for developing policies
related to open science and/or open access.

## Open science policies

When considering what open science practices to adopt for a specific project,
it is useful to consider the stakeholders in such decisions,
such as the funding agency sponsoring the research,
host institution at which the research is being conducted,
and/or journal in which research will be published.
Each of these entities may have expectations surrounding 
publishing protocols, availability of data,
sharing code, and accessibility of publications.
Even if these groups do not have *requirements*
for open science approaches,
they may support or provide access to resources that can make your open science endeavors easier to enact.

For examples of policies and guidelines related to open science,
please see the following:

## Planning ahead for open science

Engaging in open science practices is easier the earlier you start planning for them!
The following strategies are recommended to help you think about how you'll share research outputs both during the research process as well as upon its completion:

- **Data management plan:** A data management plan (DMP) is required by some funding agencies with submission of a grant application, 
but can more generally represent a project's strategy for collecting, 
storing, and publishing data. 
For more information on the elements of a data management plan and examples of how to write them, 
see the [Data section](/open-science/data_sharing/overview#data-management-and-documentation).
- **Software management plan:** A software management plan identifies a software project's strategy for sustainability, 
including the development process and governance for the project. 
For more information on how to write a software management plan and example documents, 
see the [Software and code section](/open-science/code/os-projects/#planning-for-sustainability).
- **Collaborative agreements:** Decisions to apply open science practices are the responsibility of all research collaborators. 
For general information about developing a new collaborative relationship for scientific research,
see [Ten Simple Rules for a Successful Collaboration](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.0030044).
[Guidelines for Negotiating Scientific Collaboration](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.0030217) 
includes additional information for discussing when and how research deliverables will be shared.
For projects involving computationally-intensive components,
[Ten simple rules for providing effective bioinformatics research support](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1007531)
may also provide valuable context for differentiating duties among collaborators.
