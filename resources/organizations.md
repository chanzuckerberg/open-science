This topic page focuses on organizations and projects supporting 
open science through many perspectives, including
training, advocacy, and research.
Relevant organizations are also mentioned in the specific topic pages in this website related to their work.

## Open science training 

The following organizations provide build capacity for open science by developing training materials,
teaching workshops, mentoring instructors, training cohorts, and otherwise supporting research communities:

- [Reproducibility for Everyone (R4E)](https://www.repro4everyone.org/)
- [The Turing Way](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/welcome)
- [Open Life Sciences](https://openlifesci.org/)
- [Openscapes](https://www.openscapes.org/)
- [The Carpentries](https://carpentries.org/)
- [Framework for Open and Reproducible Research Training](https://forrt.org/)

## Developing software

These organizations support research software engineering and the individuals who
engage in open source scientific software development:

- [Research Software Engineers](https://researchsoftware.org/)
- [Software Sustainability Institute](https://www.software.ac.uk/)
- [Research Software Alliance (ReSA)](https://www.researchsoft.org/)

## DEI in open science

The organizations listed below specifically support open science related activities for
demographics that are under-represented and/or marginalized in science:
