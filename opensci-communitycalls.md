This page describes community calls sponsored by CZI Open Science to engage our grantee community. 

# Who?

These calls are intended to help connect current and former members of the CZI Open Science grantee community.
Given that a large percentage of our grantee community is funded via our Essential Open Source Software for Science (EOSS) program,
the call topics reflect areas of interest to scientific open source software projects.
In addition EOSS project PIs and key personnel,
we invite other Open Science grantees to attend.
Grantees from other CZ Science grant programs,
as well as the BioHub network and members of the broader open science community are also welcome to register for the calls.

# What?

Our community calls are a partnership with [Organizational Mycology](https://orgmycology.com/),
who identifies relevant topics, schedules call times,
and hosts the events.

Calls come in two types:
1. **Topic-based calls**, which invite participants to share ideas, experiences, challenges, and successes related to a common area of interest. Call hosts collaborate with attendees to create a shared resource; you can view the summaries of previous calls [here](https://github.com/eoss-om-communitycalls#hi-there--welcome-to-the-eoss-community-call-landing-page).
2. **Collider calls**, in which attendees visit with other participants in multiple small breakout rooms during the course of the call. These are excellent opportunities to find unexpected connections with other community members and expand your personal and professional network.

# When?

In 2024, we held one topic-based call per month from July through December.
In 2025, there will be at least one call a month, switching between topic-based and collider formats.
