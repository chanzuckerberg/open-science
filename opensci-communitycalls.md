# Who?

These calls were intended to help connect current and former members of the Open Science grantee community.
Given that a large percentage of our grantee community was funded via our Essential Open Source Software for Science (EOSS) program,
the call topics reflect areas of interest to scientific open source software projects.
In addition EOSS project PIs and key personnel,
we invite other Open Science grantees to attend.
Other Biohub researchers
and the broader open science community were also welcome to attend the calls.

# What?

Our community calls were a partnership with [Organizational Mycology](https://orgmycology.com/),
who identified relevant topics, scheduled call times,
and hosted the events.

Calls came in two types:
1. **Topic-based calls**, which invite participants to share ideas, experiences, challenges, and successes related to a common area of interest. Call hosts collaborate with attendees to create a shared resource; you can view the summaries of previous calls [here](https://github.com/eoss-om-communitycalls#hi-there--welcome-to-the-eoss-community-call-landing-page).
2. **Collider calls**, in which attendees visit with other participants in multiple small breakout rooms during the course of the call. These are excellent opportunities to find unexpected connections with other community members and expand your personal and professional network.

# When?

In 2024, we held one topic-based call per month from July through December.
In 2025, there was one call a month, switching between topic-based and collider formats.
