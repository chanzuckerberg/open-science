While there are multiple ways to share details of experimental methods,
one existing solution is [protocols.io](https://www.protocols.io/),
a platform for developing and sharing reproducible methods.
This platform is free for academic users to publish and share protocols publicly.

## Benefits of protocols.io

## Types of protocols

FIXME https://www.protocols.io/what-is-protocol

Experimental protocols shared in [protocols.io](https://www.protocols.io/)
can also include computational pipelines and analytical workflows
(but see the [Software and code](/open-science/code/overview) section 
for more information on resources for reproducibility of computational methods).
Publishing computational methods in protocols.io is extremely powerful 
when a new data generation system is being documented,
as it unites the data collection and analysis approaches.
An example of this approach is this protocol from the Human Cell Atlas Method Development Community:
[MARS-seq2.0: an experimental and analytical pipeline for indexed sorting combined with single-cell RNA sequencing](https://www.protocols.io/view/mars-seq2-0-an-experimental-and-analytical-pipelin-7hkhj4w).

## Method development communities

Protocols can be organized into groups,
such as the following:
- [Human Cell Atlas Method Development Community](https://www.protocols.io/workspaces/hca/publications)
- [Neurodegeneration Method Development Community](https://www.protocols.io/workspaces/neurodegeneration-method-development-community1/publications)

Sharing a protocol with a community increases its discoverability
and maximizes its reuse.
