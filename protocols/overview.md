It is standard practice to include information about experimental methods 
in published manuscripts.
This section describes open science approaches to sharing protocols,
including both written instructions for methods
as well as physical resources (like reagents),
that support the ability of other researchers to reproduce experimental results.

## Publishing methods with protocols.io

The [protocols.io topic page](/open-science/protocols/protocolsio)
highlights the use of the protocols.io](https://www.protocols.io/) 
platform for sharing experimental results.
In addition to publishing experimental methods in manuscripts,
sharing detailed information about these methods via protocols.io
increases visibility of your methods,
facilitates onboarding of new lab members and collaborators to your projects,
and improves the capacity of other researchers to reproduce your results.

## Sharing reagents and physical resources

Examples of physical reagents and other resources that can be shared include:
- cell lines
- plasmids/vectors
- animal models
- antibodies
