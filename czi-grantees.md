Labs, projects, and researchers that are funded by CZI may have access
to additional support, resources, and services for a variety
of areas related to research and professional development.

Services specifically related to open science that are open to all CZI-supported projects include:

- **Open science office hours**: Have questions about open science approaches? Staff are available to assist CZI grantees in adopting or implementing open science practices, including sharing of all research deliverables: protocols, software/code, data, and preprints/publications. Please [schedule a time](https://calendly.com/khertweck) to meet with a member of the CZI Open Science team to discuss your topics of interest.
- **Data publishing**: Not sure where or how to publish or share your data with the rest of the scientific community? [Data Dryad](https://datadryad.org/stash) is a repository for sharing research data of any structure and type. As CZI is a Dryad member, CZI grantees are eligible to waive the fee for publishing data through Dryad.

Additional resources available to CZI grantees include:
- Movement and Capacity Building
- Program-specific meetings, webinars, etc.
