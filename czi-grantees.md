including obligations to engage in open science practices
and resources available to support these efforts.

> All CZI Science activities became a part of Biohub in November 2025. 
> Any current or former work, including grant-funded projects, 
> are now a part of Biohub as well. 
> Although some materials linked here may still reference CZI,
> we are gradually updating this language to Biohub.

**Grant operations:** Contact [sciencegrants@chanzuckerberg.com](sciencegrants@chanzuckerberg.com)
for information on no cost extensions and answers to other questions about administering your grant. 
Complete information on award policies can be found in our [standard institutional sign-off form](https://apply.chanzuckerberg.com/protected/resource/eyJoZnJlIjogOTQ1OTM2NzAsICJ2cSI6IDE2ODQ2Nn0/); 
please see the version shared with your award letter for specific details related to your grant.

### Expectations for open science practices

The following descriptions highlight general expectations for your Biohub-supported work. 
Please check your grant agreement for information customized to your grant program or RFA.

- **Protocols and reagents** are shared to support reproducibility and robustness of laboratory procedures. Share experimental methods through [protocols.io](https://www.protocols.io/), and (where possible) associate them with a relevant community, like the [Human Cell Atlas](https://www.protocols.io/workspaces/hca/publications) or [Neurodegeneration](https://www.protocols.io/workspaces/neurodegeneration-method-development-community1/publications) Method Development Community. Submit reagents and other resources, such as transgenic organisms, cell lines, and monoclonal antibodies, to existing community repositories like [Addgene](https://www.addgene.org/).
- **Software and code** are publicly available to allow other researchers to reproduce and build upon existing methods. Develop code openly and collaboratively through sites like [GitHub](https://github.com/), and release under maximally permissive open-source licenses.
- **Data** are shared to support data aggregation and reuse. Publish data using a platform like [Data Dryad](https://datadryad.org/) or the [CELLxGENE Data Portal](https://cellxgene.cziscience.com/) that allows both open, free dissemination and long-term, sustainable archival as best suits the nature of the data involved. When applicable, share both raw and processed data, always document with metadata substantive enough to maximize data reusability and format data according to best practices or commonly accepted schema.
- **Publications** are disseminated as widely and rapidly as possible. Submit manuscripts to a preprint server like [bioRxiv](https://www.biorxiv.org/) or [medRxiv](https://www.medrxiv.org/) before or upon first submission to a journal. Open access publication is encouraged, and grant funds can be used to pay for open access fees.

You are welcome to contact [openscience@chanzuckerberg.com](openscience@chanzuckerberg.com) for more information on these and other open science topics!

### Other expectations

**Ethics:** We holds ourselves and our scientific partners to the highest ethical standards.
Our [ethics policies](https://chanzuckerberg.com/ethics-policies/) 
cover all business practices in which Biohub engages, 
including encouraging respectful treatment of all persons without discrimination, 
open and honest communication, and assurance of no retaliation for reporting incidents. 
These policies also extend to cover specific issues related to scientific research: 
responsible use of grant funding, attribution of credit, and other areas of scientific (mis)conduct. 
Finally, we require compliance with institutional and national standards for non-human animal research and human subjects research, 
including supporting data privacy and security to meet national and international standards. 

**Acknowledge CZI (Biohub)** as a source of funding in all research deliverables using the following language 
(accurate for grants received in 2025 and earlier): “This project has been made possible in part by grant number «GrantNumber» from the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative DAF, an advised fund of Silicon Valley Community Foundation.”

If you would like to acknowledge CZI in presentations or other visual media as a part of your funded work, 
the approved logo for grantee usage is shown below. 
You can access the image directly [here](https://chanzuckerberg.github.io/open-science/images/CZI_Logo.jpg)

## Services available to Biohub grantees

Services specifically related to open science that are open to Biohub-supported projects include:

**Open science office hours**: Have questions about open science approaches? 
Staff are available to assist Biohub grantees in adopting or implementing open science practices, 
including sharing of all research deliverables: 
protocols, software/code, data, and preprints/publications. 
Please [schedule a time](https://scheduler.zoom.us/kate-hertweck) 
to meet with a member of Biohub's Open Science Program Office to discuss your topics of interest. 
Examples of questions other grantees have asked in office hours include:

  - I'm a biomedical researcher. How and when do I talk to my collaborators about the open science approaches we'll use for our project?
  - I'm a researcher moving into imaging experiments. How do I manage imaging data during a project, and share/publish the data when I'm ready?
  - I help lead a scientific open source software project. How can I develop the community surrounding my project, and manage it sustainably?
  - I run a patient advocacy group for a rare disease. How can I communicate and enforce expectations about data sharing and other open science practices among my collaborators and grantees?

**Open Science Community Calls**: The Open Science Program sponsored [community calls](/open-science/opensci-communitycalls) in 2024 and 2025 to share knowledge among the grantee community.
Visit [this GitHub organization](https://github.com/eoss-om-communitycalls) to see outputs from those calls.
 
**Data publishing**: Not sure where or how to publish or share your data with the rest of the scientific community? 
[Data Dryad](https://datadryad.org/stash) is a repository for sharing research data of any structure and type. 
Biohub is a Dryad member, 
so grantees are eligible to waive the fee for publishing data through Dryad by selecting CZI as a funding source when submitting data.
Learn more on the [Publishing data with Dryad](/open-science/data_sharing/data_dryad)
topic page.

**Training and capacity building:** Biohub has a offered opportunities to support the research of Biohub-funded projects, including workshops on grant writing, leadership in science, applying for faculty positions, and more.
Learn more on the [Training and Capacity Building website](https://info.chanzuckerberg.com/mcb-science-resources).

Biohub also previously offered capacity building opportunities in organizational and professional development topics like
strategic planning, communication, and workplace culture.
