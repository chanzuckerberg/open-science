Open science involves sharing research methods and results throughout the life cycle of a project.
This website shares information and resources useful for researchers,
specifically in biomedicine,
in implementing open science approaches.

Each of the main sections of this site are framed with some of the main questions we handle when applying open science approaches:

## [Protocols](/open-science/protocols/overview/)

- How do I share experimental protocols so other people can find and use them?
- What kinds of reagents, methods, and pipelines are appropriate to share?

## [Software and code](/open-science/code/overview/)

- How can I publish research code?
- What license do I choose for my code?
- How do I document code throroughly enough for other researchers to use it?
- How do I create a sustainable open source project?

## [Data](/open-science/data_sharing/overview/)

- What is included in a data management plan?
- When and where do I publish data associated with my study?
- How do I document data so others can reuse it?

## [Preprints and Publications](/open-science/publications/overview/)

- How do I discuss posting preprints with my collaborators?
- What journals support open access to publications?
- How do I know if I can share my article elsewhere besides the journal?

## [Resources](/open-science/resources/overview/)

- What are some general resources on open science?
- What organizations provide training in open science?
- How can I connect my open science activities with efforts in diversity, equity, and inclusion?
