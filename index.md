- why open science?
- biomedical research
- sharing public resources and lessons learned with everyone

Open science involves sharing research methods and results throughout the life cycle of a project.
This website shares information and resources useful for researchers,
specifically in biomedicine,
in implementing open science approaches.

The sections in the sidebar to the left highlight open science approaches representing
a breadth of research activities,
including a resources section describing other groups and projects useful for supporting these approaches.
