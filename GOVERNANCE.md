## Project history

This project was started in summer 2021 by the [Open Science Program](https://web.archive.org/web/20250910210313/https://chanzuckerberg.com/science/programs-resources/open-science/)
at [Chan Zuckerberg Initiative (CZI)](https://chanzuckerberg.com/).
As part of their role as Open Science Specialist with the Open Science team,
Kate Hertweck ([@k8hertweck](https://github.com/k8hertweck)) 
outlined the main structure and formatting of the site,
with a first pass of basic content completed in January 2022.

Additional CZI teams who were consulted during the website planning and remain stakeholders in the content include:
- **Communications:** regulate branding guidelines (colors, font, etc), approve mentions of CZI for accuracy and clarity, provide access to Plausible for web analytics
- **Legal:** oversight regarding privacy issues (related to web analytics and community feedback)
- **Science Technology:** maintain requirements for open source projects (license, language for reporting security issues, presence of a README and Code of Conduct), as well as recommendations for additional best practices in respository maintenance and to encourage community contributions

This project is currently maintained by Kate Hertweck as a part of [Biohub](https://biohub.org/)'s Open Science Program Office (OSPO).
While the content of this website still includes much general-purpose information about open science,
it is intended primarily as a tool to support Biohub researchers.

## Project goals

1. Create curated lists of public resources associated with open science methods applicable to biomedical research
2. Share resources with Biohub researchers
3. Model best practices in open source and open science for the Biohub community

## Ongoing project development and maintenance

> For more information on alternative governance models and developing documentation related to project governance,
> please see the [Governance section of the Collaborative research software engineering projects page](/open-science/code/os-projects#governance).

Topics and resources have been included on this website for one or more of the following reasons:
- a resource is well-established as representing best practices in an open-science related activity
- a Biohub researcher identified the resource as useful in the context of their work
- the resource meets a need identified by a Biohub researcher while in consultation with the OSPO

The Biohub OSPO maintains the site and curates the resources presented here as a 
[benevolent dictatorship](https://communityrule.info/create/?r=benevolent_dictator),
and retains the ability to update or modify the content as research practices and researcher needs change.

Please see our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/chanzuckerberg/open-science)
for more information about the development of the resources presented here.
Current [open issues](https://github.com/chanzuckerberg/open-science/issues)
identify additional content suggested and/or planned for development.
We welcome contributions;
